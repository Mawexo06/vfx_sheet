# On-Set VFX Sheet

This project is a Flutter Web progressive web app (PWA) for logging VFX data on set. It is designed to work offline-first, provide quick entry for common VFX checklists, and export your metadata as PDF, CSV or JSON.

## Live Demo

After each push to the `main` branch, the application is automatically deployed to GitHub Pages. Once the first deployment is available you will be able to access it at:

`https://<username>.github.io/vfx_sheet/`

(Replace `<username>` with the GitHub account name if you fork this repository.)

## Contributing

All changes should be made in feature branches via the GitHub web interface and merged back into `main` through pull requests. No local commands are required.

See the documentation in the `docs/` directory for product brief, UX guidelines, data model, export specifications and deployment instructions.
