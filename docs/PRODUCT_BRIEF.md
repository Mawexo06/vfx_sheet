# Product Brief

## Purpose
On-Set VFX Sheet is a Flutter web progressive web app (PWA) designed for film crews to log visual effects (VFX) metadata during shoots. It acts as an on-set data logger, capturing hierarchical information (project, day, slate, shot, take) and VFX-related references. The app works offline and syncs once online, and it exports logs as PDF, CSV or JSON for handover to post-production.

## Audience
- **VFX Supervisor**: Oversees visual effects on set and needs a reliable way to ensure all required plates, HDRIs and reference photos are captured and documented.
- **DIT / Data Wrangler**: Responsible for collecting and organising camera and lens metadata, managing timecode notes and ensuring that witness cameras and references are stored.

## Top Use Cases
- Creating a project and logging shooting days with location, weather and timecode source.
- For each shot, quickly recording whether HDRI, grey/chrome balls, lens grid or clean plate has been captured.
- Entering camera/lens profiles and geometric measurements (height, distance, pan/tilt).
- Adding witness camera notes and manual timecode in/out.
- Capturing photo references via web camera or upload.
- Exporting the collected data as PDF oneâ€¯-sheet per shot, or as CSV/JSON for further ingestion.
