# VFX Checklists

On‑Set VFX work often requires capturing a set of reference materials to assist the post‑production team. Use the following checklists to ensure you capture everything needed.

## HDRI / Lighting Reference

- Set up a chrome ball (for specular reflections) and a gray ball (for diffuse lighting).
- Position balls at the shooting location and ensure they are visible to all main cameras.
- Capture bracketed stills for HDRI (at least five exposures) with a 360° camera or by rotating a still camera around.
- Record the timecode and take number for each HDRI capture.

## Grey and Chrome Balls

- Hold the grey and chrome balls at eye level in the centre of the frame.
- Take a still photo with the main camera and a witness/photo camera.
- Note any unusual lighting conditions or reflections.

## ColorChecker / Lens Grid

- Place a ColorChecker chart in the scene under the same lighting.
- Capture a still or short video for calibration.
- For lens grid, shoot a grid chart at the same focal length and focus as the shot.

## Clean Plate

- After filming the take, record a few seconds of the empty set without actors or props.
- Keep camera settings identical to the take.
- Note any moving elements that may affect the plate (e.g., reflections, shadows).

## Witness Cameras

- Set up witness cameras A–D around the set if available.
- Ensure they record continuously during the take.
- Record their frame rate, resolution and lens information.
- If timecode sync is unavailable on web, note the approximate offset or jam sync manually.

Follow these checklists for each shot to ensure the VFX team has the references required to reconstruct lighting, camera alignment and scene details.
